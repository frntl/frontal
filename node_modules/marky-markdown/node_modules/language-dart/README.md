# Dart language support

Adds support for Dart snippets, grammar and syntax highlighting to Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle) from the [Dart.tmbundle](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-textmate-bundle) by the Google Dart Team.

Any and all contributions are appreciated. Send a pull request to add snippets, tweaks or grammar changes.
