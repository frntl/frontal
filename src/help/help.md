## How to write a presentation?
Creating a presentation is dead simple. Just write your Markdown like you always would. To create separate slides just split them with a horizontal line and leave a empty line before and after it.  


```text
# Slide 1

---

## Slide 2
```

---

## Markdown headings `# to ######`

Of course you can use H1 to H6

```plain
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

---

# Speaker notes

You can have speaker notes. Just enclose your text into standrad HTML comments and it will automagically appear in the "Speaker Notes" window.
